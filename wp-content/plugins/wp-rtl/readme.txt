Adds two buttons to the TinyMCE editor to enable writing text in Left to Right (LTR) and Right to Left (RTL) directions.

== Description ==
**Do you write posts in different languages that have different directions?**
This plugin enables a feature in the post editor which allow writing texts in Left-to-Right and Right-to-Left directions in the same post (or page) so you can write in English (and any other LTR language) and also RTL languages like Arabic, Persian and Hebrew.

**Simply look for the new buttons added to the post editor after installing the plugin.** (See the screenshots for better understanding)

* Note: This plugin will not change the direction of the post title, since that is controlled by the theme.

== Installation ==

Search for the plugin "wp-rtl" from the plugin page inside your WordPress dashboard, or to manually install it do the following:

1. Upload the folder (wp-rtl) to the plugins directory (wp-content/plugins).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Clear your browser cache (This is important otherwise you will see the cached TinyMCE).

== Screenshots ==

1. The post editor showing the new direction buttons.
2. Switching to the text editor shows the added direction to the RTL line.
3. A test post showing the correct alignment for the languages.
